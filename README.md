### **2. Scope Plane**

Once the strategy is set and the abstract objectives have been defined,
we can contextualize this in the Scope Plane. The objectives will be
reviewed into clear goals, which will be fulfilled by a list of features
the website will need to follow.

#### **Features**

The website will have three different pages which will be accessible at
any point from any of the pages, you’ll land on the home page which will
include course information and a link to the sign up form. It will also
include partners the company regularly interacts with and values which
they stand for. The second page will be solely on the information
regarding the different mentors available, while the third page will
have the sign up form, and the contact information.

### **3. Structure Plane**

On the structure plane, the ways in which the user navigates the website
are defined, where will the user land, what will be his options from
where he lands and further on.

As the user accesses the website, he’ll be landing on the home page,
where he will be greeted by a hero video clearly portraying a sense of
professional development. Here, he’ll notice the navigation bar at the
top, present in all pages, which will be able to take him to a mentor
page and a signup page, and just below the video he’ll find two buttons
supported by a slogan which will give him the option to download the
course program and to sign up.

If the user decides to scroll down the website, he’ll view the values
the company stands by and the companies that \[platform\] is involved
with. At the bottom of the website, there will be a footer with
important information replicating in every page. This footer will
include the address where the company can be found, any social media
links and further navigation tools.

If the user decides to instead click on either of the links at the top
of the website, he’ll be redirected to the mentors or sign up form.

The mentors webpage will have display in a minimalistic view the
different mentors available together with a short description and their
name. The sign up page will have a form requesting contact information
from the user together with a text box where the applicant can state
what his intentions are with the course to be best matched with a
mentor. This site will also have contact information.

### **4. Skeleton Plane**

At the skeleton plane the layout of the website is designed. Wireframes can be used for this:


### **5. Surface Plane**

The surface plane is concerned with the visual aspects of the specific
features of the site. Below is each one listed with the design
principles alongside.

Font used: Comfortaa.

Color scheme used:

- Main Color:

- Supplementary Color:

- Secondary Color:

- Highlights Color:

Feature \#1: Navigation Bar

The navigation bar will be present in every page. It will show the logo
at the top left and the navigation options on the top right. All of
these features will be animated when hovered over in a similar fashion,
scaling up and changing color to the highlights color. Additionally, the
selected website will be enlarged and have an underline.

It is worth noting that in resolutions smaller than 768px, the
navigation bar links will be collapsed into a burger menu.

<img src="media/image2.png" style="width:6.5in;height:0.38889in" />

Feature \#2: Hero Video

The landing video is displayed across the entire width, on autoplay,
looped and muted.

<img src="media/image8.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.18056in" />

Feature \#3: Propaganda section buttons and slogan.

The website maintains a consistent presentation across the pages,
enveloping the headers into a off-white rounded boxes. Boxes will have
rounded edges, and be animated on hovering and on selecting. This will
be done by scaling up and changing the color distribution.

<img src="media/image1.png" style="width:6.5in;height:0.70833in" />

On the values section, there will be a number of cards which pull down
on hovering which reveal the description for each of the values.

<img src="media/image3.png" style="width:6.5in;height:1.31944in" />

On the partners section, a scrolling gallery has been added, showing
with more dynamicity and interest the logos of the companies
\[platform\] is involved
with.<img src="media/image4.png" style="width:6.5in;height:1.40278in" />

The footer section shows the address of the company, the social media
links and a further navigation link option. Each of the elements will be
scaled and change color when hovered over.

<img src="media/image6.png" style="width:6.5in;height:0.93056in" />

The mentors section shows clearly profile images of each of the mentors,
on a dimmed grayscale. When hovered over, the images will turn into
color and a bio including the relevant industry will pull down from each
of the cards.

<img src="media/image9.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.06944in" />

<img src="media/image5.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.11111in" />

will require First Name, Surname, Email address, Password and an
application box where applicants can send out a brief on why they want
to join the mentorship program. Each of the items is animated
differently on hovering and on selecting. The submit button is also
animated.

<img src="media/image7.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.04167in" />

4.  <u>Responsiveness</u>

## **Deployment**

Deployment of this website has been done through the repository found in
GitHub.
([<u>https://github.com/RodriVazquezAsenjo/PP1---Platform</u>](https://github.com/RodriVazquezAsenjo/PP1---Platform))

Once in this link, click on the settings tab on the top navigation bar.

After, click on the pages tab on the left-hand menu under the code and
automation section.

Here, under the “Build and Deployment” on the “Source” drop-down menu,
select “Deploy from a branch”.

Next, select “Main” on the “Branch” drop-down menu, and ensure the
folder is set to /(root) and save.

This will automatically deploy your site, for confirmation, ensure that
a new section on the pages section shows up which states that the site
is live.

**Git Clone**

*Cloning will be linked to your repo and any pushes they make will come
to you for approval.*

Git cloning is essentially creating a copy of an existing code from a
remote repository to your local repository. It is a key tool that allows
collaboration between developers when producing a code and also allows
for individuals to use an existing code as a baseline. When cloning a
code, the associated files, commit history, branches and tags when
downloaded to your local machine.

To clone a code you’ll need to follow these steps:

1.  Download the chrome extension for GitPod which can be found
    > [<u>here</u>](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gitpod/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki)
    > and more information can be found
    > [<u>here</u>](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/introduction).

2.  Restart your browser.

3.  Navigate to your desired Project Repository.

4.  On the top right corner a GitPod button should be seen. If pressed,
    > it will take you to the GitPod workspace and open up a copy of the
    > project repository you wish.

It is worth noting that any pushes intended to be done to the original
code will request approval from the author of the original code.

*Forking will be in a new repo belonging to them. If you make changes to
your repo, they’ll be informed and have the option to pull from yours.*

**Git Fork**

An alternative to cloning, which maintains a relationship to the
original repository, is forking. With forking you create a copy of a
repository to your own account on Github. This means that the two
repositories (original and forked) are now independent and the user is
free to make any changes to the repository.

To create a fork, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to your desired repository.

2.  Click on the fork button on the top-right corner, above the GitPod
    > button.

3.  Once forked, click on the GitPod Button.

**Note:**

*Any changes pushed to the main branch will automatically show up to the
main site.*
